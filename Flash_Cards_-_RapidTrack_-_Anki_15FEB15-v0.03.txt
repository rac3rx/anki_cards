109c. To make changes persistent through a system reboot, edit the 'SELINUX=' line in which file?	/etc/selinux/config  for either 'enforcing', 'permissive', or 'disabled'. For example: 'SELINUX=permissive'
109d. SELinux follows the model of least-privilege; by default everything is denied and then a policy is written that gives each element of the system only the access required to function. True or False	True
109e. SELinux model of least-privilege is a description that best describes the strict policy. True of False?	True
109f. By design, SELinux allows different policies to be written that are interchangeable. The default policy in CentOS is the targeted policy which "targets" and confines selected system processes. True or False	True
109g. SELinux has 3 forms of access control, what are they?	Type Enforcement (TE), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Multi-Level Security (MLS)
109h. Type Enforcement is the primary mechanism of access control used in the targeted policy, true or false?	True

109j. Multi-Level Security (MLS): Most commonly used and often hidden in the default targeted policy, true or false?	false conversely not commonly used.
109k. The SELinux Troubleshooting tool is provided by the setroubleshoot package. The tool may be launched from the X Window GUI manager System menu or from the CLI how?	sealert -b

109m. # ls -Z /html/index.html  -rw-r--r--  root root user_u:object_r:default_t    /html/index.html; put the correct selinux context.	# chcon -Rv --type=httpd_sys_content_t /html 
109n. To make the security context changes permanent, even through a complete filesystem relabel, we can use the SELinux Management Tool or the 'semanage' command from the command line:	semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/html(/.*)?"
109o. Suppose a user edits a copy of index.html in his/her home directory and moves (mv) the file to the DocumentRoot /var/www/html. How would the user recursively restore the default security contexts for the whole directory /var/www/html?	# restorecon -Rv /var/www/html
109p. Sometimes it is necessary to relabel the complete filesystem although this should only be necessary when enabling SELinux after it has been disabled or when changing the SELinux policy from the default targeted policy to strict. To automatically relabel the complete filesystem upon reboot, do?	# touch /.autorelabel; reboot
109q. We may want a service such as Apache to be allowed to bind and listen for incoming connections on a non-standard port. By default, the SELinux policy will only allow services access to recognized ports associated with those services. If we wanted to allow Apache to listen on tcp port 81, we can add a rule to allow that using the 'semanage' command?	# semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 81
109r. A full list of ports that services are permitted access by SELinux can be obtained with?	# semanage port -l
109s. semanage is found in what package?	policycoreutils-python which is not installed by default and note there is a separate policycoreutils package
109t. Finding the right context to use as you manage a system is difficult. Name two places to start are?	ls -Z, look at the directories and data pre-installed by a package and copy the contexts already used.  The alternate tool is seinfo -t which lists all contexts currently in use on your system. grep for the name of your application
109u. What log contains SELinux errors/conflicts	audit.log
109v. audit2allow is actually easier to use than presented here. When you have a conflict between two contexts, find the error messages in audit.log and extract them to a separate text file. Feed the errors back to audit2allow, a useful example would be?	audit2allow -M mynewpolicyname <errors.txt
109w. What will be generated is mynewpolicyname.te and mynewpolicyname.pp along with helpful instructions on how to import the new policy. This new policy will enable whatever was previously conflicting, true or false?	True
109x. to list all SELinux booleans?	getsebool -a
